# hcmus-mods-backend
- This is a backend source code for my hcmusmods courseworks at school (not enough API yet).
- It was built based on NodeJS, ExpressJS, PostgreSQL with REST API
- I implemented JWT to authenticate and authorize users when using API
- I used monolithic architecture to build this project and organized source code by layers.
